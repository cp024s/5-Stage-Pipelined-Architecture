# 5 Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor in RTL

## Introduction
This repository contains the RTL (Register-Transfer Level) design and implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor. The RISC-V architecture is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that is becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to high-performance computing.

## Features
5-Stage Pipeline: Efficient pipelining for improved instruction throughput.
RISC-V ISA: Implements the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
Modular Design: Well-structured, modular RTL code for easy understanding and customization.
Simulation and Testing: Testbenches and simulation scripts for functional verification.
Performance Metrics: Tools for measuring performance and latency.
Documentation: Detailed documentation on the architecture, implementation, and usage.
